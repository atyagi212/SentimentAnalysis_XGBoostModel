    "# Lab 4.1: Implementing Sentiment Analysis\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will develop a solution to perform sentiment analysis on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate machine learning (ML) algorithms that are used in natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis\n",
    "- Create a solution to a sentiment analysis business problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing the business scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will play the role of a data scientist on a small development team. The organization that you work for maintains a website of movie reviews. A key customer feature was identified: to provide an overall *Smiley Face* (positive inference) or *Sad Face* (negative inference) for a particular movie based on the number of its positive and negative reviews. You will develop an ML solution that developers can use to create an inference for a movie review. You will need to analyze the review and indicate if it is positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help with this task, you have access to a dataset that contains the raw text of 50,000 movie reviews. These reviews have been labeled either as positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "About this dataset\n",
    "The Large Movie Review Dataset is a collection of highly polar movie reviews. This data supports work in the following paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. \"Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis.\" Presented at the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2011), Portland, Oregon, USA, June 2011. http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains a single text field containing the review. The dataset is labeled either positive (1) or negative (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "text: Text of the review\n",
    "label: Whether the review is positive or negative (1 or 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this lab, you will follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Installing packages](#1.-Installing-packages)\n",
    "2. [Reading the dataset](#2.-Reading-the-dataset)\n",
    "3. [Performing exploratory data analysis](#3.-Performing-exploratory-data-analysis)\n",
    "4. [Running the first pass: Minimal processing](#4.-Running-the-first-pass:-Minimal-processing)\n",
    "5. [Running the second pass: Normalizing the text](#5.-Running-the-second-pass:-Normalizing-the-text)\n",

    "## Submitting your work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the lab console, choose **Submit** to record your progress and when prompted, choose **Yes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the results don't display after a couple of minutes, return to the top of the lab instructions and choose **Grades**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** You can submit your work multiple times. After you change your work, choose **Submit** again. Your last submission is what will be recorded for this lab.\n",

It is heartening to see that the dynamics which seem to influence the award for Best Actor (often going to showy pyrotechnic display) aren't at work in the female categories. Just as Emma Thompson's hugely well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in \"Howard's End\" proved that one of the hardest things that an actor can do is make the portrayal of \"goodness\" involving, so Binoche's win proved that it could be that - and seriously sexy.

The film opens up in Switzerland as Holmes is in disguise as an \"old bookseller.\" He must bring Dr. Tobel and the Tobel Bomb Site to England before the Germans can kidnap Tobel. Holmes succeeds and the Germans recuit the evil Professor. Moriarty manages to outwit Scotland yard and LeStrad \"Dennis Hoey\" by kidnapping Tobel. The only clue left by Tobel is a list of \"dancing men.\" Who will break the hidden code of dancing men, Holmes or Moriarty first?

Ice-T did his bad guy thing and, well, that was the highlight of the evening. The pictures of the shuttle looks like it was done with a little toy inside of a box and the spacewalking scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space suits. The script was lacking and the car chase scene with the guy bleeding and going unconscious was incredible because he drove better than I could have on one of my best days.

       "22143  There have been several comments already on the site focusing on the \"prestige\" feel of the film - and there is a lot of heavy-weight talent on show: from Fiennes and Scott-Thomas to the magnificently rendered design and scoring, to the masterly direction. No wonder that Andrew Lloyd Webber's acceptance speech for \"Evita\" at that year's Oscars began \"Well, thank God that \"The English Patient\" had no songs in it.\" Writing of Oscar winners takes me to Juliette Binoche, who, in a stellar cast, gives a beautiful performance. It is heartening to see that the dynamics which seem to influence the award for Best Actor (often going to showy pyrotechnic display) aren't at work in the female categories. Just as Emma Thompson's hugely well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in \"Howard's End\" proved that one of the hardest things that an actor can do is make the portrayal of \"goodness\" involving, so Binoche's win proved that it could be that - and seriously sexy. Her performance in this terrific film is a thing of beauty.   \n",
